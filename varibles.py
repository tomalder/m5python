# a varible is made of 3 parts
# first we have the varible name
# varible names start with lower case letters
# part 2 of a varible is the assignment character, this is a single =
# part 3 is the value to be assigned to the varible
# varibles are used to store values in ram

a = 2

#^ this is a whole number referd to as an interger, int

b = 1.5

#^ this is a float it has a decimal point

c = 'chicken'

#^ this value is known as a string, str

d = True

#^ this is a boolean True or False (Yes or Nos)

# the value for varibles have different data types



# EXAMPLES
e = a**2 #4
f = a+b  #3.5
g = a*c  #chickenchicken
h = c+c  #chickenchicken
print(e, f, g, h)
k = str(a) + c  #2chicken using str() changes the interger to a string this is called casting
l = '4'
m = a * int(l)
print(k, l)
